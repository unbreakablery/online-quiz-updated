As the patient has specifically requested information on how to make a complaint is it appropriate for you to provide that information (option G).  Whilst informing your seniors is appropriate there is no overriding imperative for this to be immediate hence option C is incorrect. As the ward sister has seen fit to inform you of the situation it is appropriate for you to take steps to address the situation yourself rather than pass it back to the nursing team as in option F. Option H spends time having a conversation with the ward sister that adds nothing and is likely to sound patronising and Option E is admitting responsibility on behalf of your team for substandard care that may not in fact have taken place. \n\nSJS3P2',NULL,''),

Asking the patient to elaborate on their reasons for coming gives them an opportunity to express their concerns and is the primary of purpose of the consultation (option F). \nLeaving the room, or ignoring the crying (options A or H) are less sensitive to the non-verbal cues the patient is giving. \nOption E sounds compassionate and physical contact is not forbidden when patients are in distress, however in this instance a hug would be inappropriate as Michael, a male doctor is alone with a vulnerable young female patient.

Options B and C are inappropriate for you in your capacity as a doctor as you should remain professional and not discuss the results with your friend, this could not only worry her without getting answers to her questions but also be a breach of confidentiality.  Trying to subtly ask her about her diagnosis is also using your knowledge inappropriately.  If at all possible you should avoid treating friends and family.  Option H is not any better - despite remaining anonymous you are still not distancing yourself, and the note could still easily be linked to you.Option E is also inappropriate as you are not an independent advocate or professional involved in the case and therefore should not pose as such.

Reporting this incident to the GMC would be very extreme and in this instance an informal challenge may be sufficient (option E).

At present the information has been relayed to you by a relative and it is not clear how much you have consent to share with the brother. \n2. A - Seek advice from the Overseas Visitor Team. This is a good option, these are the experts in this unusual situation and will give you more information and advice and may be able to clarify whether this patient will be paying for his treatment or not.  The scenario says the Overseas Visitor Team has alerted him to the fact that he \"may not be eligible\" and is \"potentially liable\" so there is no definite liability established.  \n3. E - Research cheaper treatment options and reduce costs where you can by prescribing cheaper pain relief and antibiotics.\nThis option is worse than Options A and E as it assumes that there is a liability to pay for treatment and the word \"Research\" implies you do not currently know of the cheaper options and will need to look into them which will probably take some time.  If these alternatives are not in standard use they may not be immediately available in the hospital pharmacy.  This research may be unnecessary if the patient proves eligible.\n4.

B - Speak to your FY1 colleague informally over lunch and ask if there is anything bothering him\nYour colleague was previously conscientious and his behaviour has only changed in the last two weeks so it is likely that something has happened in his personal or professional life to prompt this behaviour. The most appropriate option would be to speak to your colleague informally to see if you can offer any support.\n2. C - Discuss your concerns with your clinical supervisor (a respiratory consultant)\nThis is the next most appropriate option as your clinical supervisor is a respiratory consultant and may be able to provide you with advice. He or she may also have noticed the change in your colleague or be aware of wider circumstances. Option B is more courteous to your colleague than going directly to a senior regarding his behaviour.\n3. D - Discuss your concerns with your educational supervisor (an orthopaedic consultant).\nThis is the next most appropriate option as again you are asking for advice from a senior. However, it is better to speak to your clinical supervisor as this will be seeking advice from within your team.  \n4. A - Take no action currently but do something if it continues for another two weeks\nThis is not appropriate as the scenario states that you are concerned about your colleague and that you are finding it difficult to cope and you should do something about it before the situation deteriorates. This is s better than option E as doing nothing for now with a caveat to review in two weeks is better than doing something destructive now. \n5. E - Complain loudly in the doctors\' mess that your FY1 colleague is never around\nThis is the least appropriate option as complaining in this manner to whoever happens to be in the doctor\'s mess is not constructive.  This option includes no plan to anything about the issue now or at a later date.  You have no idea what is causing the change in your colleague - it may be due to a devastating personal circumstance.

There is no reason to purposely withhold information from Mrs Jackson\'s daughter if you are happy that the patient would like her case discussed with her daughter therefore option D is unnecessary and underhanded. Option E is very dismissive and creating work for the nursing staff while a doctor should be the one to explain the notes written by the medical team. Option F would therefore be a much better option as you can provide answers to any questions Mrs Jackson may have.

Give the handover list to the night registrar oncall and request the information is passed on to your colleague when she arrives. It is preferable to handover directly to your colleague which is why options A and B rank higher, however you do at least handover to a doctor who is on call and who can pass the information on.\nE. Ask the ward nurses to bleep the oncall doctor in an hour with the jobs they have informed you of. This is a poorer option than A, B or C as the nurses may too busy to bleep again in an hour, tasks may slip through the net or your colleague may still not have arrived. It also is inconsiderate to ask the nurses to take back the responsibility for tasks that have been given to you to complete or handover. This option is better than option D as at least it leaves the nurses aware that these tasks are not being handled.\nD. Leave on time because you are not paid to stay after your shift and are tired after 5 days on call.

Option A is not sensible - you cannot apologise on someone else\'s behalf - once it is raised in the meeting, your colleague can apologise if they wish. Options C and F are dangerous and insensitive - they suggest that the patient\'s worries are unfounded and dismiss her concerns. Option E may be true but is not a helpful thing to discuss with this patient in distress, similarly Option H is unlikely to help the situation and may make the patient feel her feelings are being marginalized.  The desire to defend your colleague is commendable but until you have discussed this further it would be dangerous to assume that your colleague had not made a mistake in this case - even if the pain was severe, given the lady specifically asked for a treatment that is safe in pregnancy this would not be a sensible treatment to offer. \n\nSJM1Q55',NULL,''),

The staff of the restaurant have brought her water and are asking if they can help further. She does not recover the way you would expect from a simple faint and continues to get more pale.

She has been treated for a fractured left wrist and you strongly feel that Mary will struggle with the activities of daily living until her wrist has fully healed. When you suggest arranging temporary social care Mary is adamant that she can cope and tells you she does not wish to discuss the matter further. Mary lives alone and her closest neighbour is two miles away, her only family is an estranged daughter.

Contact Mary’s GP promptly with details of this A&E visit \nH. Make a referral to social services for a home assessment \n\nThe GMC guidance states that you “must contribute to the safe transfer of patients between healthcare providers and between health and social care providers” and that “where practical, that a named clinician or team has taken over responsibility when your role in providing a patient\'s care has ended. This may be particularly important for patients with impaired capacity or who are vulnerable for other reasons.”.  In this instance it is appropriate to ensure that Mary’s GP is informed of her fracture and treatment in A+E (Option E). The scenario clearly states that you strongly feel that Mary will struggle with the activities of daily living after her fracture, that she is frail and that she lives alone in a remote location – so she is vulnerable and it is appropriate to make a referral to social services to ensure that Mary is able to care for herself safely in her home environment (Option H). The GMC guidance also states “You must work in partnership with patients, sharing with them the information they will need to make decisions about their care” and given your concerns it is appropriate to continue the discussion of social care to ensure that Mary is making informed decisions following a full discussion of the risks involved (option B rather than option A). Mary is not discharging herself against medical advice (Option C) as her fracture has been treated and the scenario suggests she is medically fit for discharge so there is no need for her to return to A&E is she changes her mind (Option D). Contacting Mary’s GP in a week’s time to request an urgent home visit introduces a needless delay and may not be an effective use of NHS resources as Mary is clearly able to travel by taxi and a home visit may not be required.

','The preferred response is:  \nB. Try to persuade Mary to accept a social care assessment \nE. Contact Mary’s GP promptly with details of this A&E visit \nH. Make a referral to social services for a home assessment \n\nThe GMC guidance states that you “must contribute to the safe transfer of patients between healthcare providers and between health and social care providers” and that “where practical, that a named clinician or team has taken over responsibility when your role in providing a patient\'s care has ended. This may be particularly important for patients with impaired capacity or who are vulnerable for other reasons.”.  In this instance it is appropriate to ensure that Mary’s GP is informed of her fracture and treatment in A+E (Option E). The scenario clearly states that you strongly feel that Mary will struggle with the activities of daily living after her fracture, that she is frail and that she lives alone in a remote location – so she is vulnerable and it is appropriate to make a referral to social services to ensure that Mary is able to care for herself safely in her home environment (Option H). The GMC guidance also states “You must work in partnership with patients, sharing with them the information they will need to make decisions about their care” and given your concerns it is appropriate to continue the discussion of social care to ensure that Mary is making informed decisions following a full discussion of the risks involved (option B rather than option A). Mary is not discharging herself against medical advice (Option C) as her fracture has been treated and the scenario suggests she is medically fit for discharge so there is no need for her to return to A&E is she changes her mind (Option D).

Preparing a list will be helpful and may save time during handover but is not as good as staying in person for a full handover. \nC. Give the handover list to the night registrar oncall and request the information is passed on to your colleague when she arrives. It is preferable to handover directly to your colleague which is why options A and B rank higher, however you do at least handover to a doctor who is on call and who can pass the information on.\nE. Ask the ward nurses to bleep the oncall doctor in an hour with the jobs they have informed you of. This is a poorer option than A, B or C as the nurses may too busy to bleep again in an hour, tasks may slip through the net or your colleague may still not have arrived. It also is inconsiderate to ask the nurses to take back the responsibility for tasks that have been given to you to complete or handover. This option is better than option D as at least it leaves the nurses aware that these tasks are not being handled.\nD. Leave on time because you are not paid to stay after your shift and are tired after 5 days on call. This is the worst option as it abandons your responsibility to complete or handover the tasks assigned to you. It is unsafe for your patients as your colleague would have no means of knowing the jobs outstanding and the nurses are not aware that the tasks have not been done or handed over. Had you been too tired to work safely the ranking may have been different but the scenario states that you are planning on socialising this evening so any tiredness is clearly not overwhelming.\n\nSJM1Q1\n',NULL,''),

This way a prescription can be given as required and a formal record made.\nD. Offer to take them both down to your local Accident and Emergency. This should not be your first port of call for a relatively minor complaint, but at least it ensures that Jack is assessed by someone who is supposed to be on duty, who can document the assessment (A&E attendances are sent to the GP for their records) and also seek specialist opinion as needed.\nA.

It may not be the perfect answer, but a good rule of thumb is first of all do no harm. How much of an assessment can you do at home? Do you have access to all of Jack\'s records; does your indemnity insurance cover you for this? As an F2 doctor are you sufficiently experienced to diagnose and treat without supervision?

Also and you will have no access to Jack\'s records. The GMC have set out new guidelines about private prescriptions, and even though you can write them, there is a good chance the pharmacist will report you to the GMC for further investigation.

Find the number for the out of hours GP for dad to get further advice. This is the best option as it ensures that the appropriate advice is sought. Otitis media is very common in young children and is appropriate for a GP to assess and treat. This way a prescription can be given as required and a formal record made.\nD. Offer to take them both down to your local Accident and Emergency. This should not be your first port of call for a relatively minor complaint, but at least it ensures that Jack is assessed by someone who is supposed to be on duty, who can document the assessment (A&E attendances are sent to the GP for their records) and also seek specialist opinion as needed.\nA. Say that you are not allowed to prescribe medication outside of work and there is nothing you can do medically. Be apologetic and distract Jack from his ear pain. It may not be the perfect answer, but a good rule of thumb is first of all do no harm. How much of an assessment can you do at home? Do you have access to all of Jack\'s records; does your indemnity insurance cover you for this? As an F2 doctor are you sufficiently experienced to diagnose and treat without supervision? You are then leaving it up to the parent as to whether they want to get advice elsewhere. Answers C and D are better though as they are more proactive ensuring appropriate care.\nB. Bring your auroscope down and examine Jack\'s ear. If it looks like otitis media prescribe amoxicillin as a private prescription.\nThis option leaves you practicing independently beyond you competence (as an F2 in GP you would be well supervised). Also a more detailed examination may be needed to rule out other causes for a febrile child - if missed this could harm the child and open you up to litigation. Also and you will have no access to Jack\'s records. The GMC have set out new guidelines about private prescriptions, and even though you can write them, there is a good chance the pharmacist will report you to the GMC for further investigation.

It is also important that the issue is escalated appropriately as this is clearly not a one-off issue - the scenario states that Mr Lamb has not eaten for some time. It is important for the nurse in charge of the ward to be informed (Option D) so that any systemic or supervisory issued can be handled. As there are ongoing issues between Sarah and the nursing team simply advising Sarah of the need to inform the nurse in charge (Option C) may not be sufficient and advising Sarah to inform the Consultant of a “problem with the nurses”(Option E) is likely to exacerbate her issues with the nursing team. Sarah should be encouraged to establish an effective working relationship with the nursing team and to raise valid concerns directly where appropriate (Option F).  ',NULL,''),

Do you have access to all of Jack\'s records; does your indemnity insurance cover you for this? As an F2 doctor are you sufficiently experienced to diagnose and treat without supervision?

Trying to subtly ask her about her diagnosis is also using your knowledge inappropriately.  If at all possible you should avoid treating friends and family.  Option H is not any better - despite remaining anonymous you are still not distancing yourself, and the note could still easily be linked to you.Option E is also inappropriate as you are not an independent advocate or professional involved in the case and therefore should not pose as such.  It may help you to talk to your educational supervisor so that they understand what has happened and that you may now feel in an uncomfortable situation and therefore option F is advised.    It would be responsible to consider if there is an appropriate audit which could help improve reporting systems in the future and this could be done in collaboration with your educational supervisor.  Option G is beyond your remit and responsibility and could be handled better by the general audit suggested in option F.\nSJM1Q42\n',NULL,''),

Accept that your Educational Supervisor is more experienced than you and respect your senior\'s opinion. \nWhilst it is good to respect seniors, it is far more wrong to allow a patient to continue with what your feel is sub-standard treatment because you are too quiet to speak up.

Stop the antidepressant as you don\'t think the patient is depressed. \nIt would be unwise to stop this medication when you have never seen the patient before, you are querying a psychiatric diagnosis, and you have limited experience in psychiatry. This could cause even more harm and in no way would address the issue that you feel they need referral to a specialist. \nSJM1Q12',NULL,''),

Option B would be inappropriate as it is dishonest.  It is important never to try to conceal errors that you have made but admit them as soon as you realise in order to correct them.  Option C would be potentially putting the patients at harm.  Option D is recommended as although this consultant has a reputation for being fierce, he is more likely to respect you telling the truth with a plan for what you are doing already to rectify the situation rather than holding back this information.\nOption E is inappropriate as you should under no circumstances pretend this has not happened or remove yourself from the situation without telling a colleague as you are putting patient\'s lives at risk.  Option F allows the potential for mistakes as no-one is clear what the plan is and could result in either patient receiving treatment based on the wrong results by another member of staff on the ward.\nOption G would be appropriate because if you already have a plan for repeating the tests and then you ask the consultant for a plan based on each result, this means you are able to continue your jobs later in the day without the need for him to return to the ward for a reassessment.\nSJM1Q41',NULL,''),

An anonymous poster has confidently given advice which is dangerous and could threaten the patient\'s health and pregnancy. \n\nChoose the three most appropriate actions to take in this situation','A. Flag the post to be removed by the site admin','B. Give the correct advice','C. Identify yourself as a doctor giving your full name','D. Ignore it - the internet is full of bad information','E. Leave an anonymous post with better advice','F. Post online advising the patient to see their doctor','G. Refute the dangerous advice','H. Review the most recent information relevant to the condition','CFG','The preferred answer are:\n\nC. Identify yourself as a doctor giving your full name \nF. Post online advising the patient to see their doctor\nG. Refute the dangerous advice\n\nWhilst you have no legal responsibility here you can potentially prevent a dangerous situation and should act. (option D incorrect) You will need to post something and identifying yourself gives what you post credence. The most important thing is to refute the dangerous advice and to send the patient to see a doctor as a physical consultation is always going to be vastly preferable to an online encounter. Giving the right advice (option B) may seem a good option but refuting the dangerous is of more immediate importance. Reviewing the most recent information (option H) and flagging the post to site admin (option A) are both good options but are not as immediate and therefore not part of the best answer. An anonymous post can be easily ignored or only given similar weight to other anonymous posts (option E).','The preferred answer are:\n\nC. Identify yourself as a doctor giving your full name \nF.
